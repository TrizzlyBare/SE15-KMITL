\
        The bustle in a house\n\
        The morning after death\n\
        Is solemnest of industries\n\
        Enacted upon earth,
        â€”\n\
        \n\
        The sweeping up the heart,\n\
        And putting love away\n\
        We shall not want to use again\n\
        Until eternity.\n\
